# Mining Guide

## Overview
This blockchain uses Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism for mining new blocks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Running blockchain node
- Wallet address for mining rewards

### Start Mining

1. Create a wallet first:
```bash
./blockchain-node createwallet
```
This will output your new address and private key.

2. Start the node with mining enabled:
```bash
./blockchain-node startnode --mining --miner YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS
```

Example:
```bash
./blockchain-node startnode --mining --miner 0x742d35Cc6635C0532925a3b8D5c6C1C8b1c5C6C
```

## Mining Process

### Block Creation
1. Node collects pending transactions from mempool
2. Creates new block with transactions
3. Adds miner reward transaction (2 ETH)
4. Starts proof of work mining

### Proof of Work
- Algorithm: SHA256-based with difficulty adjustment
- Target: Hash must be less than target value
- Nonce: Incremented until valid hash found

### Block Rewards
- **Block Reward**: 2 ETH per mined block
- **Transaction Fees**: Sum of gas fees from included transactions
- **Uncle Rewards**: Not implemented in current version

## Mining Configuration

### Difficulty Adjustment
- Current: Fixed difficulty of 1000
- Future: Dynamic difficulty based on block time

### Gas Limits
- Block Gas Limit: 8,000,000 gas
- Max Transactions per Block: 100

### Mining Pool Support
Currently not supported. Each node mines independently.

## Monitoring Mining

### Check Mining Status
Mining status is displayed in node logs:
```
Mining block 123 with 5 transactions...
Block 123 mined in 2.3s! Hash: 0x1234...
Block 123 added to blockchain
```

### Check Balance
```bash
./blockchain-node getbalance YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS
```

### Mining Statistics via RPC
```bash
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8545
```

## Hardware Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- CPU: 2 cores
- RAM: 4 GB
- Storage: 10 GB SSD
- Network: Stable internet connection

### Recommended Requirements
- CPU: 4+ cores
- RAM: 8+ GB
- Storage: 50+ GB SSD
- Network: High-speed internet

## Mining Economics

### Profitability Factors
1. **Electricity Cost**: Main operational expense
2. **Hardware Cost**: Initial investment
3. **Network Hash Rate**: Affects mining difficulty
4. **Block Reward**: Currently 2 ETH per block

### Cost Analysis
```
Daily Blocks Mined = 24 hours / Average Block Time
Daily Revenue = Daily Blocks * Block Reward
Daily Profit = Daily Revenue - Electricity Cost
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Mining Issues

1. **No transactions to mine**
   - Node will mine empty blocks
   - Transactions are added from mempool

2. **Mining too slow**
   - Check CPU usage
   - Difficulty may be too high

3. **Mining stops unexpectedly**
   - Check node logs for errors
   - Ensure wallet address is valid

### Mining Logs
```
2024-01-01 12:00:00 Starting miner...
2024-01-01 12:00:01 Mining block 1 with 0 transactions...
2024-01-01 12:00:03 Block 1 mined in 2.1s! Hash: 0xabc123...
2024-01-01 12:00:03 Block 1 added to blockchain
```

## Security Considerations

### Wallet Security
- Keep private keys secure
- Use hardware wallets for large amounts
- Backup wallet files regularly

### Network Security
- Use firewall rules
- Monitor for unusual network activity
- Keep node software updated

## Future Improvements

### Planned Features
1. **Pool Mining**: Support for mining pools
2. **GPU Mining**: CUDA/OpenCL support
3. **Dynamic Difficulty**: Automatic difficulty adjustment
4. **Merged Mining**: Support for auxiliary chains

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Parallel Mining**: Multi-threaded mining
2. **Optimized Hashing**: Assembly-optimized hash functions
3. **Memory Optimization**: Reduced memory usage
